     <h1>Raised in an anti-plastic culture,  <br> a sustainably focused adult…</h1>
        <p>I didn’t use a lot of plastic growing up. The government and schools intervened so early there was a lot of cultural stigma around using single-use products, especially if they couldn’t be recycled. <br><br>When I was in elementary school women from the recycling center came to my school and held an assembly (all parents and students were required to attend). They talked about recycling practices in Colorado, they really stressed not putting non-recyclable plastic into the bin.<br><br>“Thin, flimsy, plastic-like bags are difficult to recycle; without specialized equipment they clog machines. And even when plastic wrap is recycled, it's costlier than using virgin materials. When it ends up in landfills or incinerators, both PVC and PVDC can release a highly toxic chemical called dioxin, says the World Health Organization.” <br><br>When I was young, my elementary school held a mandatory assembly, all the parents were invited. Two women from the local recycling center came in to speak with us all about sustainable living. They explained that instead of using single use products and non-recyclable plastics we should find alternatives. It became a competition between the Moms to pack their children with the most sustainable lunch bags. My carrots suddenly went into a Tupperware, sandwich into a paper bag, and my oranges were left to roll around in my bag. My mom even invested in reusable juice boxes to ensure we wouldn’t miss anything from our old lunches. Since third grade, my family’s experience with reusable packaging has grown and our collection of products has expanded.
